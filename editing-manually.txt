Non-selectable elements
-----------------------

- deletion
- insertion
- Helix lines
- DNA sequences
- BoundSubstrand


Selectable elements
-------------------

- 5' end (including of substrands; figure out a wait to show them in a mouseover so they can be selected)
- 3' end (same)
- Loopout
- crossover
- Strand (by clicking on BoundSubstrand)
- Helix circle (can move left/right/up/down)


Operations
----------

- delete with delete key
  - 5'/3' end (deletes substrand)
  - crossover
  - loopout
  - strand
  
- insert by clicking
  - deletion
  - insertion
  - strand (subsequently drag to extend its length)
  - crossover when two substrands on adjacent helices with opposite forward fields have ends at the same offset
  
- move left/right
  - 5'/3' end
    - changes length of substrand if one is selected; in this case limited not to overlap adjacent substrands with same forward field
    - moves whole substrand if both are selected; in this case cannot overlap substrand with same forward field, but *can* move beyond it
  - crossover (limited to largest overlapping offset intersection of current Substrands it is connecting)
  - Strand (same move rules as substrand)
  - Helix circle (changes starting offset of Helix)
  
- move up/down
  - substrand
  - strand
  - Helix circle (changes idx order)
  
If a strand is selected and moved, then if any of its constituent elements (5'/3' end, Substrand, crossover) are also selected, they are ignored during the move since moving the Strand will move all of them as well.
